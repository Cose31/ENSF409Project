# ENSF409Project

Worked on a Project in 2nd Year Software Engineering that involved creating a schedule builder for a volunteer center for animals (fictional).
This project involved taking a database and parsing data, creating a schedule that worked with the given requirements of all animals and if it could not be built
adding functionality to call more volunteers on the system created for the volunteers.

The project involves Java coding, a sleek GUI and a functional system to confirm more volunteers for the center when they are required. 

A UML diagram for the project is included.
Testing scenarios were also required, therefore testing common errors that the code would encounter was ruled out.
